# htmldiff.js
### HTML Diffing in JavaScript (ok, CoffeeScript actually.)

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tnwinc/htmldiff.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/tnwinc/htmldiff.js)

`htmldiff.js` is a CoffeeScript port of https://github.com/myobie/htmldiff
(This one has a few more tests.)

This is diffing that understands HTML. Best suited for cases when you
want to show a diff of user-generated HTML (like from a wysiwyg editor).

##Usage
You use it like this:

```coffeescript

  diff = require 'htmldiff'
  console.log diff '<p>this is some text</p>', '<p>this is some more text</p>'
```
And you get:

```html
<p>this is some <ins>more </ins>text</p>
```
##Module

It should be multi-module aware. ie. it should work as a node.js module
or an AMD (RequireJS) module, or even just as a script tag.
